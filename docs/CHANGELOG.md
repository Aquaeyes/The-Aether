# The Aether - NeoForge - 1.20.2-1.3.0

**This release is a full port of 1.20.1-1.2.0 to NeoForge 1.20.2!**

Additions

- Added two new tags that are now used in relevant recipes: `aether:gems/zanite` and `aether:processed/gravitite`.
- Added a new registry `aether:advancement_sound_override` which makes it easier for addon developers to override advancement sounds like for dungeons.
- Added a new placed feature `aether:aether_grass_bonemeal` to use for bone meal on Aether Grass instead of using the Vanilla-equivalent placed feature.
- Added descriptions for the Inebriation and Remedy effects that can be viewed with mods like JEED.

Changes

- Prefixed screen overlays with the Aether's mod ID internally.

Fixes

- Fixed the fuel duration message for REI not being localized without JEI installed.
- Fixed some sprites in crafting stations being a couple pixels off.
